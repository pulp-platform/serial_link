## Physical Layer

The Physical Layer of the Serial Link has multiple channels where each channel has a configurable number of lanes and its own source-synchronous clock. The physical protocol is essentially based on oversampling which is achieved by sending the data with a generated divided clock. The data is sent with either Double-Data-Rate (DDR) or Single-Data-Rate (SDR).

### Protocol
The physical protocol of the Serial Link is shown below

The data is sent synchronous to a generated divided clock, which is generated by a simple and SW configurable clock divider. Further, a clock is forwarded together with the data to sample the data on the receiving side. This forwarded source-synchronous clock typically has a phase shift of 90 or 180 degrees, for DDR or SDR, respectively, such that sampling occurs when the eye opening is at a maximum. The exact phase shift is configurable i.e. the negative and positive edge of the forwarded clock can be configured independently by SW.

### TX Channel
The implementation of a TX channel is pretty simple. It contains a clock a configurable clock divider for generating the divided data and the forwarded clock. In case of DDR the TX channel just multiplexes the output based on the data clock. To signal when actual data is being sent the TX channel clock-gates the forwarded clock i.e. in idle operating mode the forwarded clock is tied to `'1`.

### RX Channel
On the RX side a CDC FIFO takes care of synchronizing the data to the system clock. DDR is handled by sampling the first part of data on negedge-triggered FF and sampling the second part directly with the CDC Fifo which is positive-edge triggered.
